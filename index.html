      <h2>History of Antipolo</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long ago, Antipolo's slopes were shaded by towering tipolo trees, which gave the town its name. Antipolo is known as the "Pilgrimage Capital of the Philippines."<br>
	  It's a destination for pilgrims, especially during May, when people devote themselves and join the Alay Lakad tradition, walking to the Antipolo Cathedral. Over the years,<br>
	  Antipolo continued to grow its reputation. Even during the American period, travelers sought its cool climate and breathtaking views, a welcome retreat from the <br>
	  scorching heat of Manila. And then there was Hinulugang Taktak, the waterfall whose steady flow has provided its wonder all through generations. In 1998, Antipolo <br>
	  was finally named as a city. It was no longer just a tranquil place for pilgrims to visit; it was now a busy center of faith, history, and progress. History pours like its<br>
	  waterfalls and rises like its hills in Antipolo, a city rich in nature, devotion, and untold stories.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Antipolo Cathedral — formally the International Shrine of Our Lady of Peace and Voyage.
		Recently, in 2024, the cathedral was officially recognized by the Vatican — becoming the first 
		Marian International Shrine in Asia. It is a major pilgrimage location, and millions of devotees visit 
		this destination. People go to church, and it's a natural part of our life cycle. It's a habit for the 
		people to go to church every Sunday weekend — they go to church to pray, ask for forgiveness, 
		give thanks, and feel the presence of the Lord. So if you're set on a spiritual journey, Antipolo 
		Cathedral is a must-visit destination you should go to.</p>
